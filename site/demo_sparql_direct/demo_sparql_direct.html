        <title>WINDSWEQ - The WINDsor Semantic Web English Query interface - Live Demo with RDF Triplestore</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Live Demo - New Semantics - SPARQL version - Direct Query Interface</h1>
	<h2>A Demonstration of our new semantics remade using a SPARQL endpoint as the triplestore</h2>
        <p>
	This is a live demo of the Solarman application for Natural Language queries to event based semantic web data.
	Previously our demonstration used an in-program triplestore.  To demonstrate the real-world applicability of our semantics,
	we have redesigned our demo to use a SPARQL endpoint instead as its triplestore.  This improved version is faster and now
	operates directly on the semantic web.
        </p>
	<h3>Novel additions</h3>
	<p>
	In addition to these changes, we also demonstrate our support for 
chained prepositional phrases in our semantics here.
	We also demonstrate a novel way to handle the word 'by', as used in the
 passive form of a verb (e.g., 'discovered by'), by treating it directly
	as a preposition.  In doing this, we can support queries such as 'which
 moon was discovered in 1877 by hall' without any added complexity to
	the semantics.
	</p>
	<h3>Query interface</h3>
        <p>
        In the input field below, you may type and run any valid query using the semantic combinators and functions. 
        </p>
	<p>
	Queries are written as expressions in the Haskell language.
	</p>
        <p>
        <b>Examples:</b> which moons $ orbit jupiter <br><br> which planets $ orbited_ [by $ a (moon `that` discovered_ [by galileo])]

        </p>

	<p>You can also access the endpoint via a speech front end, on Windows 
or Android by installing the JavaScript version of speech browser. You 
can install the browser here <a href="http://speechweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/index.php?page=install_guide">here</a>, and then <a href="http://speechweb2.cs.uwindsor.ca/solarman2/demo_sparql/"> access the speech app</a>.

	<h2>How to use</h2>

	<p>Unlike the natural language interface, this interface accepts 
expressions in the Haskell language to evaluate semantic queries.  That 
is, you, the user, have the direct ability to construct and evaluate 
queries using our parser combinators.  Try some of the examples above.</p>

	<p>Some things to note: there are two transitive verbs used in 
Solarman, 'discover' and 'orbit'.  Depending on your use of these verbs,
 the appropriate version must be called.  "discover" is the active voice
 (i.e. "hall discovered a moon"), "discover'" is the active voice with 
support for prepositional phrases, and "discover_" is the passive voice 
with prepositional phrases.  Note that we treat 'by' as a preposition in
 our grammar.  An example query using the passive voice: 'phobos $ 
discovered_ [by hall]' (in English: "phobos was discovered by hall").  
An example query in the active voice: 'hall $ discovered' phobos [in' 
1877, with $ a telescope]' (in English "hall discovered phobos in 1877 
with a telescope")</p>

	<p>We permit the (.) and ($) operators from the prelude, and any 
function defined in that file, in queries.  SafeHaskell prevents the 
evaluation of any other function.</p><p>
