        <h1>Live Demo - New Semantics - SPARQL version - Natural Language Interface</h1>
	<h2>A Demonstration of our new semantics remade using a SPARQL endpoint as the triplestore</h2>
        <p>
	This is a live demo of the Solarman application for Natural Language queries to event based semantic web data.
	Previously our demonstration used an in-program triplestore.  To demonstrate the real-world applicability of our semantics,
	we have redesigned our demo to use a SPARQL endpoint instead as its triplestore.  This improved version is faster and now
	operates directly on the semantic web.
        </p>
	<h3>Novel additions</h3>
	<p>
	In addition to these changes, we also demonstrate our support for 
chained prepositional phrases in our semantics here.
	We also demonstrate a novel way to handle the word 'by', as used in the
 passive form of a verb (e.g., 'discovered by'), by treating it directly
	as a preposition.  In doing this, we can support queries such as 'which
 moon was discovered in 1877 by hall' without any added complexity to
	the semantics.
	</p>
	<h3>Query interface</h3>
        <p>
        In the input field below, you may type and run any valid query using the semantic functions. 
        </p>
	<p>
	Queries are written in lower case English with no punctuation.

        </p>

	<p>You can also access the endpoint via a speech front end, on Windows 
or Android by installing the JavaScript version of speech browser. You 
can install the browser here <a href="http://speechweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/index.php?page=install_guide">here</a>, and then <a href="http://speechweb2.cs.uwindsor.ca/solarman2/demo_sparql/"> access the speech app</a>.
