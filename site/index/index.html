        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
        This is the demonstration page for our new version of Solarman 
which can be used to query an RDF triple store on the semantic web.
        This version uses a SPARQL triplestore as the database for 
queries.
	</p>
	<p>
	Two interfaces are provided to interact with our system.  The first 
interface is a Natural Language Interface where the user can enter
	queries as English sentences which are in turn mapped to our parser 
combinators using an attribute grammar to provide query results.  The 
second interface
	is our Direct Query Interface which allows the user to evaluate and 
combine our parser combinators directly.
