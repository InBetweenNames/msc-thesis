Dr. Frost:

1) Why important and why non trivial already addressed--does more need to be done?

2) I'd like to overhaul the demonstration to be much easier to use, since it's current form is not very user friendly.

3) modifitications to the semantics: implicit `and' problem fixed

4) Should I have a whole 'related work' section?

5) I see related work uses Web Ontologies
