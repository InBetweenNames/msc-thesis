\chapter{Introduction}

%INTRODUCTION:

The Semantic Web is a network of online databases that store facts in the form of {\em triples}.  A {\em triple} is a 3-tuple that has the form $(\text{\em subject}, \text{\em predicate}, \text{\em object})$, where {\em subject}, {\em predicate}, and {\em object} are Uniform Resource Identifiers \cite{rdf}.  These {\em triples} compose the basic elements of the Resource Description Framework data model that underlies the Semantic Web, and databases that contain them are commonly referred to as 'triplestores'.

%THE PROBLEM:

Although how information is represented in the Semantic Web is standardized by the W3C \cite{w3csemanticweb}, the problem of how to actually query information contained within it is still an area of active research.  A summary of existing approaches is detailed below:

%SUMMARY OF EXISTING APPROACHES:

\begin{itemize}
\item SPARQL - more to learn
\item SMEAGOL - 
\end{itemize}

%THE PROBLEM WITH EXISTING APPROACHES:

However, these existing approaches share a shortcoming in that they do not allow for prepositional phrases in queries, and therefore have limited coverage of the English language.

%OVERVIEW OF NEW APPROACH:

The work presented in this thesis draws on two main concepts: executable attribute grammars\cite{frosthafiz2008} and event-based denotational semantics\cite{frostagbola2014}.

Executable attribute grammars are a natural way to accommodate Natural Language queries \cite{?}, and since they allow top-down rather than bottom-up parsing, they are highly modular \cite{frosthafiz2008}.

Event-based denotational semantics operate on event-based triplestores\cite{frost2014demonstration} rather than traditional triplestores.  Triplestores describe entities and their relations to other entities, but a problem exists in how to add contextual information to a particular triple.  In an event-based triplestore, events are used to link facts rather than entities, and information about entities may be gleaned from the events in which they occur.  Additional information about an event may be added by simply adding a new triple to the triplestore.  The key motivation behind using event-based triplestores is that they directly support reification on triples\cite{?}.

THESIS STATEMENT: By integrating a novel event-based denotational semantics with a parser constructed as an executable attribute grammar, it is possible to create a highly modular and extensible Natural Language Interface to the Semantic Web that supports the use prepositional phrases in queries.

PROOF OF CONCEPT: We prove the Thesis by creating an online English query interface to a triplestore containing thousands of facts about the solar system. \cite{Solarman:2016}.

Some example queries that can be handled by this system include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item ``when was something discovered at mt\_wilson''
	\item ``how was the thing that was discovered at flagstaff discovered''
	\item ``what was discovered in 1877 in us\_naval\_observatory''
	\item ``what planet is orbited by a moon that was discovered in 1684''
	\item ``which vacuumous moon that orbits jupiter was discovered by nicholson or hall with a telescope in 1938 in mt\_wilson or mt\_hopkins''
\end{itemize}

In addition to this, we demonstrate a novel method of handling the word ``by'' as used in the passive form of a verb by treating it directly as a preposition within our grammar, unifying our treatment of active and passive verbs.  In doing this, we are able to accommodate queries such as ``which moon was discovered in 1877 by hall'' without any added complexity to the semantics.\\
