\chapter{Parser Combinators}

The parser combinators as described in this thesis differ from their original implementations
in \cite{frost2014demonstration} \cite{frostagbola2014}.  The most significant change is that
the combinators are now monadic in nature rather than being strictly pure.  This change was
required in order to safely handle streaming information from external triplestores in Haskell.
In addition to the changes to the combinators, the parser used \cite{frosthafiz2008} was also
extensively modified to properly handle monadic values.
