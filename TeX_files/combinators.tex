\chapter{Parser Combinators}

The parser combinators as described in this thesis differ from their original implementations
in \cite{frost2014demonstration} \cite{frostagboola2014}.  The most significant change that I made is that the combinators are now monadic in nature rather than being strictly pure functions.  This change was required in order to safely handle streaming information from external triplestores in Haskell. In addition to the changes to the combinators, the parser used \cite{frosthafiz2008} was also extensively modified to properly handle monadic values.
