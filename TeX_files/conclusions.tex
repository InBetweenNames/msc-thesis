\chapter{Conclusions}

In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to create a highly modular and extensible Natural Language Interface to the Semantic Web that supports the use of prepositional phrases in queries using our approach.  One area where our research could be particularly relevant is in constructing Natural Language Interfaces for IoT-enabled devices.  It could be feasible to provide an interface to control a variety of these devices using our apporach, improving accessibility for users who suffer disabilities.  As the Semantic Web becomes more mainstream, there will be an increasing need for enabling technologies like these.  It is our hope that researchers in the future will consider building on our approach in order to fulfill this growing need.
