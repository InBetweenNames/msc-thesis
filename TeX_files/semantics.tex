\chapter {Event-Based Semantics}

One problem with traditional triplestores is that it is difficult to add contextual information to a triple.  Two common examples of contextual information are time and location.  Many approaches that allow this use a method called {\em reification} \cite{?}.

An event-based triplestore is a special case of a triplestore where information is organized into events.  For example, the triple (``sally'', ``met'', ``susan'') in a traditional triplestore could be represented by three triples in a event-based triplestore:

(``event1'', ``type'', ``meet'')

(``event1'', ``subject'', ``sally'')

(``event1'', ``object'', ``susan'')

The advantage of this approach is that it is possible to add additional information by simply adding more triples with ``event1''.
