\chapter {Event-Based Semantics}

One problem with traditional triplestores is that it is difficult to add contextual information to a triple.  Two common examples of contextual information are time and location.  Many approaches that allow this use a method called {\em reification} \cite{?}.

An event-based triplestore is a special case of a triplestore where information is organized into events.  For example, the triple (``sally'', ``met'', ``susan'') in a traditional triplestore could be represented by three triples in a event-based triplestore:

\begin{code}
	(event1, type, meet)
	(event1, subject, sally)
	(event1, object, susan)
\end{code}

The advantage of this approach is that it is possible to add additional information by simply adding more triples with event1:

\begin{code}
	(event1, year, 1955)
	(event1, location, Windsor, Ontario)
\end{code}

The key motivation behind using event-based triplestores in this Thesis is that they directly support reification on triples\cite{frostagboola2014}.

The improvements from the original semantics presented in \cite{frost2014demonstration} \cite{frostagbola2014} are detailed below.

\section{The use of `by' as a preposition}

\section{Efficiency improvements}

The ``collect'' operation now has a worst-case time complexity of O$(n$ log $n)$ time.
